# Worklog 2026-05-30 — UMA fence/TDR + cross-game black-3D

Running worklog. Append entries; commit+push often.

## Goal
1. UMA experiment (a): isolate whether the Adreno GPU TDR is caused by the buffer
   being NON-SPARSE vs HOST-VISIBLE-DEVICE-LOCAL.
2. Cross-game black-3D + low-fps fix: in-game 3D world not reaching frontbuffer
   (Blue Dragon ~2fps flat-blue + HUD; Burnout in-race black). Suspect MSAA
   render-target resolve / EDRAM->frontbuffer path on Adreno.

## State at start (HEAD 8a5dfd8fa)
- UMA hang = real Adreno TDR, ~50%, frozen VdSwap ~1200. Ruled out: coherency,
  budget, CPU-write-vs-deferred-read race (serialize experiment refuted it),
  maxStorageBufferRange. Remaining structural diff: staging buffer is SPARSE,
  UMA buffer forced NON-SPARSE host-visible-device-local.
- Stable speed path = UMA off, ~60fps to menus.

### E1 (start) — expose vulkan_sparse_shared_memory to launch intent
The sparse path is gated by `vulkan_sparse_shared_memory && !gpu_uma_direct_shared_memory`
(vulkan_shared_memory.cc:94). So experiment (a) variant "non-sparse + device-local +
staging copy" = launch with gpu_uma_direct_shared_memory=false AND
vulkan_sparse_shared_memory=false. That cvar wasn't in the Android allow-list; added
it (EmulatorActivity.java). Needs a build. Test matrix once built:
- baseline sparse staging: uma=false, sparse=true (default) -> expect STABLE (known)
- NON-SPARSE staging:      uma=false, sparse=false        -> if it TDRs, NON-SPARSE
  alone is the trigger; if stable, host-visible-device-local memory is the trigger.
- UMA direct (ref):        uma=true                       -> ~50% TDR (known)
